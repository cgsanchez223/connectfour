This was a project for the Software Engineering program at Stony Brook University.
- Unit 16.2
- This unit focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and learning about classes in JavaScript.
- With classes we can use constructors to compile information into objects.
- We can use classes to extend information to other classes.
- We can also use "this" in constructors to compile information

Connect 4 Project:
- Using constructors and the keyword "this", we created a table that mimics the popular board game Connect 4
- We construct information for 2 players p1 and p2
- The board is 6 x 7, with the height being 7 due to implementing a feature to drop a piece in the board
- Using event listeners we can allow the top row to be clicked and switched between players
- When a player has 4 colors in a row, they win the game - a congratulations message is provided
